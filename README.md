# LVQ-based-hand-gesture-recognition-using-a-data-glove


This paper presents a real-time hand gesture recognizer based on a Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) classifier. The recognizer is formed by two modules. The first module, mainly composed of a data glove, performs the feature extraction. The second module, the classifier, is performed by means of LVQ. The recognizer, tested on a dataset of 3900 hand gestures, performed by people of different gender and physique, has shown very high recognition rate.
